## TicTacToe Progressive Web App

This is a simple TicTactoe app built with Angular 16.

- The project is hosted at Firebase, you can access it
  [HERE](https://angular-ticktack.web.app/)

##### Features

- The 'AI' is created using the
  [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). It still requires
  some work, to prioritize winning as fast as possible.
- There is an **EASY-mode**, that can be toggled on the top left of the screen.
  This will make the 'AI' pick random squares.
- The project is a [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app), so
  you can download it to your device, and it will work like a native app.

##### Purpose

- The app was a quick and fun way to test out the Firebase hosting and
  deployment, as well as Angulars PWA capabilities.
